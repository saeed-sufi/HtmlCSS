# HtmlCSS
## A summary of important points I learn about Html and CSS

* `jpegs` are good for big photos but they don't allow for transparent pixels. `gif` is good for simple animation but not good for color palette. `png` is good for anything which is not a photo or an animations including logos, icons, technical diagrams,... . `svg` is vector based so they are good for everything that `png` is good for especially for responsive design. Downside of `svg` is that if there's a lot if text in them, their file size skyrocket.

* The `width` attribute in an `img` tag is dimensionless. 

* Always specify the language of your website (in the opening html tag) and add charset meta in the `head` section.
